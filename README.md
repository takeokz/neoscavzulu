To do list:<br>
Remake NEOSCAV zulu directory for easy access and bookkeeping.<br>
Remake and re-add previous iterations of guns.<br>

STORY:<br>
Make sure to import the addition changed to the cryo wake-up section of the story so it is possible to pre-load legendary traits from accumulating.<br>
Add Michigan Department of Transportation as a minor, then major faction in the future. With this, add metro lines to allow easy fast-travel in Michigan.<br>
Add the Professor, the founder of Haggerty Health Clinic. Can only encounter if you have a hospital wrist strap with you. If not, access to the Professor is not possible. Provides services and friendship levels depending on tasks completed.<br>
Add the Jack's Outlaws faction, a group of ex-convicts residing in jackson state prison, establishing a militia and self-sufficient from pillaging and trading with looters. They sell hand crafted and prison equipment to the players. Depending on friendship you can also get a lot of good benefits.<br>
Add the Flint Theocracy, a sub-sect of the Blue Frog Church that are characterized by their different clothing (to be decided later.) More aggressive, stronger (from the Flint water) and batshit crazy. Upon the destruction of the church there can also be a new story where the Flint Theocracy absorbs the Blue Frog Church? Not sure.<br>
